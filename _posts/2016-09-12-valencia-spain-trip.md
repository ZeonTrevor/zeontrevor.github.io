Hey! In this post, I will give a short overview of my trip to Valencia Spain with details about how accessible the city is for a traveller with LGMD.

We travelled by the Renfe train from Barcelona to Valencia which is about a three and half hour journey. We had initially booked the tickets from Barcelona to Valencia via an intermediate station and it was mentioned that both our trains as well as the stations were disabled friendly. But on the day of travel when we visited the Atendo service desk ([assistance for people with reduced mobility or disability](http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/atendo/index.html)) they told us that the intermediate station is a small station with no disability access and that the person who provides assistance has to be informed 12-24 hours in advance. So we had to cancel the online booking and buy a ticket which took us directly to Valencia. Once this issue was sorted out, their assistance with respect to assisting you till the train seat, or accompanying you till mode of transport at the destination was good. Thus, I advice you to contact the Atendo service desk in advance, even if the online portal mentions that the train journey is completely accessible.

The metro network is excellent as its mostly accessible for disabled travelllers except for a few stations ([link](http://www.metrovalencia.es/page.php?page=150)). We took a metro trip to the hotel [DormaValencia](dormavalencia.com) where we were staying. They have accessible rooms with step-in showers and lifts to access the rooms.

On the first day, we visited the Valencia Cathedral located in the Valencia Old Town. The Cathedral itself is disabled friendly, but since its located in the Old town it is difficult to stroll outside the Cathedral because of small cobbled streets. I would recommend taking a taxi that would leave you right next to the Cathedral.
