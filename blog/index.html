<p>Hey there! I currently live in Germany pursuing my masters, originally from Sri Lanka (although for the most part of my childhood and youth I have lived in India). My love story with Germany started from the day I watched Die Mannschaft (German football team) play in the 2002 FIFA world cup finals, but since living here I love it even more for many other reasons like its beauty and convenience for reduced mobility individuals.</p> 

<p>I was diagnosed with LGMD back in 2010, its a rare disease that causes weakness and wasting of the muscles in the arms and legs. As I grow old and the disease progresses, I constantly update my life ;). Since its a rare disease and there is very little known about it, I dedicate this blog to create awareness and especially help those who have this disease by sharing my travel diaries across Europe from the eyes of a LGMD traveller.</p>
